# Text-Editor
Creating a text editor that works offline!

## Summary:
In this project I was tasked with creating a text editor that works offline! When writing in the text editor in airplane mode or anywhere without a stable internet connection, the software will save those changes and will be available when you return back to internet! I started with existing code and added in the logic for a method that accepts input and adds it into an IndexedDb as well as gets all the input from the IndexedDb!
